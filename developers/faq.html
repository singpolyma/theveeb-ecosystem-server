<h2>So you want to distribute your applications?</h2>

<h3 id="cross-platform">Isn't cross-platform development hard?</h3>

<p>That really depends on what kind of application you're building.  There are a number of libraries and frameworks out there that can help you build your software in a more portable fashion.  Check out our <a href="http://wiki.theveeb.com/Cross%20Platform%20Development">tips on cross-platform development</a>.</p>

<h3 id="guarantee">What kind of guarantees do I have from you?</h3>

<p>Here at The Veeb, we know that developers are what make our services useful to consumers.  Without applications to distribute, there is no point in having a distribution system.  With that in mind, we make the following commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will not distribute your software to any person or organisation that has not paid a minimum of your asking price.</li>
<li>We will not allow other developers to use your name, logo, or other material in their applications without your permission.</li>
<li>We will not make it ridiculously hard to get your money.  If you've made money, then you're entitled to have it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dependancies">What if I need a library you don't have?</h3>

<p>The Veeb Ecosystem handles installing all dependency libraries of your application, so that you don't have to.  If we do not currently have the libraries you need, we will get them.  We need to be able to redistribute the libraries, however, so some proprietary libraries may not be options.  If you can convince the library author to allow us to distribute it, then we should be able to work something out.  In addition, we cannot usually port proprietary libraries to new platforms and architectures as we choose to add support for them, so they should be avoided if at all possible.</p>

<h3 id="revenue">How much of the money do I get?</h3>

<p>Currently we are sharing revenue 70/30 with developers.  That is, you get 70% of the revenue from the sale of any of your applications.</p>

<h3 id="costs">How much does it cost to distribute with The Veeb Ecosystem?</h3>

<p>Getting your application into The Veeb Ecosystem costs nothing.</p>

<h3 id="content_licenses">What do these content licenses mean?</h3>

<p>These are licenses that you can choose to apply to the "content" in your application.  Content is graphics, sound, and anything else that is not source code.  By default we offer support for the following licenses.  (Disclaimer: these are not complete or legal descriptions of the licenses, only informal summaries.  None of these licenses affect normal fair use or fair dealings or permit otherwise criminal activity.)</p>
